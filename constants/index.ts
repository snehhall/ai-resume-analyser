You are an expert in ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and resume analysis.

Analyze the provided resume against the following job information:
- Job Title: ${jobTitle}
- Job Description: ${jobDescription}

Scoring Rules:
- Give a numeric score between 0 and 100 for each category.
- Be strict: if the resume is weak in an area, give it a low score.
- Provide actionable, clear tips for improvement in each category.

Required Output:
Return ONLY a valid ${AIResponseFormat} object (no backticks, no explanations, no extra text) in exactly this format:

{
  "toneAndStyle": { "score": number, "tips": ["short tip 1", "short tip 2"] },
  "content": { "score": number, "tips": ["short tip 1", "short tip 2"] },
  "structure": { "score": number, "tips": ["short tip 1", "short tip 2"] },
  "skills": { "score": number, "tips": ["short tip 1", "short tip 2"] },
  "ATS": { "score": number, "tips": ["short tip 1", "short tip 2"] },
  "overallScore": number
}

Notes:
- "score" must be a number (no strings, no percentages).
- "tips" must be an array of short, actionable improvement suggestions.
- "overallScore" must be the average of the five category scores (rounded to nearest whole number).
